Love the direction. Here are crisp, brand-able token name options (with tickers) tuned to your thesis: yield-powered, trust-weighted, community currency.

Shortlist (top 12, with vibe)
	1.	Yubi (YUBI) — “yield + UBI”; friendly, universal.
	2.	Trustline (TLIN) — credit-by-trust; clear for merchants.
	3.	FlowCred (FLCR) — cred derived from network flow.
	4.	Vouch (VOUT) — endorsement-native; dead simple.
	5.	Chorus (CHRS) — many voices → one signal; communal.
	6.	Weave (WEAV) — graph stitched by relationships.
	7.	Nadi (NADI) — “channel/flow”; short, global.
	8.	Sawa (SAWA) — “together” (Swahili); solidarity vibe.
	9.	Civica (CIVA) — public-good, civic trust energy.
	10.	Tide (TIDE) — recurring cycles; yield in/out.
	11.	Orbi (ORBI) — global, circular economy feel.
	12.	Pluma (PLMA) — light, low-friction value.

Note: some tickers may already be used—do a quick conflict check before locking in.

If you tell me the brand vibe (serious vs playful, global south resonance vs neutral, tie to Boost/Relay vs standalone), I’ll narrow to 3 winners and draft logos + token icon specs.
