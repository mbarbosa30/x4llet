Yes—add one focused screen. Think of it as a “BoostPay” page (Savings-Backed Pay Later), with a tiny detail view per purchase. Without it, users won’t grok yield vs top-ups vs maturity.

The BoostPay page (single screen)

Header (at-a-glance strip)
	•	Spendable limit (live)
	•	Locked / Unlocked savings (tap to adjust lock)
	•	Outstanding (sum of active purchases)
	•	Next payment (date & amount)
	•	Health: ✅ OK • ⚠️ Attention • 🔴 Action needed

Module 1 — Active purchases
List of cards, newest first. Each card shows:
	•	Merchant • Item/Note • Amount
	•	Progress bar split into colors: Yield / Top-ups / (Principal at maturity)
	•	Maturity date • Days left • Health tag
	•	Actions: Top up, Repay now, Adjust plan, Receipt

Card microcopy (example):

$150 to TelCo Shop • due in 10 mo
Paid so far: $42 (Yield 31, Top-ups 11)

Module 2 — Savings engine
	•	“You’ve saved $1,000 USDC • est. APY 6%”
	•	Lock slider: “Locked for BoostPay: $1,000” (edit → confirm)
	•	Note: “With this setup you can cover ≈ $60/yr from yield.”

Module 3 — Plan & safety
	•	Top-up plan: Weekly / Monthly / None (shows $/period)
	•	Max principal at maturity (cap slider, e.g., $0 → $150)
	•	New-merchant cool-off (toggle)
	•	Notifications: maintenance alerts, top-up reminders

Module 4 — How it works (collapsible)
	•	3 bullets, plain language:
	1.	You keep savings invested.
	2.	Future yield + top-ups repay purchases.
	3.	If needed, we use up to your cap of principal at maturity.

Purchase detail view (tap any card)

Header: Merchant • Amount • Maturity • Health
Ring chart: Shares of Yield / Top-ups / Principal (cap)
Timeline: Payments & yield credits by month (checkmarks)
Controls:
	•	Change top-up (picker)
	•	Lock more savings (one-tap)
	•	Repay now (full/partial)
	•	Cancel (if within grace window)
Receipts: pcNFT ID, on-chain tx, shareable PDF/QR

Banners for edge cases
	•	APY down: “Coverage short by $9 → Add $1.50/wk or lock +$150.”
	•	Maintenance call: “Health 1.04 (< 1.10). Fix with Top-up $8 or Lock +$120.”

⸻

Home page hook (no extra screen bloat)

Add a compact BoostPay card:
	•	“Spendable: $200 • Outstanding: $150 • Next: $7.50 Tue”
	•	Button: Open BoostPay

⸻

Copy you can ship (micro)
	•	Health OK: “Your plan is on track.”
	•	Attention: “APY fell—add $X or top-up $Y/wk.”
	•	Action needed: “You’ll hit maturity short by $Z. Choose: Add funds • Increase top-ups • Allow principal (≤ cap).”

Footnotes (tiny): “APY is variable. Principal use never exceeds your cap.”

⸻

Visual language (keeps it understandable)
	•	Colors: Yield (one color), Top-ups (second), Principal at maturity (neutral).
	•	Icons: 🌱 Yield, 🔒 Locked savings, ⏳ Maturity, 🛟 Health.
	•	Numbers: big, monospaced amounts; always show network + token.

⸻

Offline & low-signal behavior
	•	Cache the page; show last synced values with a “may be 10m old” badge.
	•	Queue top-up changes and plan edits; show Pending until online.
	•	Execute-by-link still works from detail view (share button).

⸻

Safety & guardrails surfaced in UI
	•	Hard caps visible: “Max principal at maturity: $90.”
	•	Withdrawals: block or warn if it harms health:
“Withdrawing $100 would push Health to 0.96. Choose a fix.”
	•	Tenor limits: select 2–12 months only; show payoff math instantly.

⸻

Data you need for this page
	•	Vault: saved, locked, apy_est
	•	Per-purchase: amount, maturity, paid_yield, paid_topups, principal_cap, health_ratio, next_due
	•	Derived: spendable_limit, outstanding_total, suggested_fix (X to lock / Y to top-up)

⸻

Implementation sketch (React)
	•	BoostPayPage
	•	SummaryStrip
	•	PurchaseList → PurchaseCard*
	•	SavingsModule
	•	PlanModule
	•	HowItWorks
	•	PurchaseDetail (route: /boostpay/:id)
*Each card receives a small suggestFix() prop that returns the two best one-tap fixes.

⸻

QA checklist (v1)
	•	Health calc matches contract math across edge APYs.
	•	Changing top-up/lock updates Spendable and Health in real time.
	•	Offline: actions queue; no silent failures.
	•	Internationalization: long numbers, RTL, decimals.
	•	Accessibility: 44px tap targets; high contrast; screen-reader labels.

⸻

Bottom line: yes—ship a single BoostPay page + per-purchase detail. It keeps the mental model crystal clear (yield vs top-ups vs principal), gives one-tap fixes when conditions change, and fits your lightweight PWA ethos.
