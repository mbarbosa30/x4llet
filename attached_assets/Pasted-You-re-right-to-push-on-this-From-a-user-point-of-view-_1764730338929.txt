You’re right to push on this 😄
From a user point of view it really is “just register” — the invite stuff is mostly a dev / SDK detail.

Here’s what the docs actually say and how I’d translate it for nanoPay.

What the docs say is needed to register as a human

From the current Circles SDK docs:  ￼

To register a human avatar via the SDK you need:
	1.	A wallet on Gnosis Chain (xDAI)
	•	Your EOA must be connected to Gnosis (chainId 100).
	•	You need a tiny bit of xDAI for gas.
	2.	An inviter avatar address (dev-level requirement)
SDK method:

sdk.register.asHuman(inviter: string, profile: Profile | string): Promise<HumanAvatar>;

	•	inviter: address of an existing Circles avatar that invites the new human.
	•	This method “handles invitation redemption automatically” – meaning you don’t have to call a separate “accept invite” function; it does the invite + accept in one go.  ￼
In practice, the official Circles app can just use a default inviter or some onboarding flow so the user never sees this.

	3.	A simple profile
	•	profile can be:
	•	A Profile object ({ name: 'Alice', description: '…' }), or
	•	A CID string pointing to JSON on IPFS.  ￼
At minimum, name is required.

Once sdk.register.asHuman succeeds:
	•	The wallet now is a Circles human avatar.
	•	You can call avatar.getMintableAmount() and avatar.personalMint() to start minting/claiming CRC.  ￼

How this maps to what users experience

On the front-end (like nanoPay or the official Circles app), you don’t need to expose any of that.

For a regular user, the real requirements are:
	•	Have a wallet (same one nanoPay uses, or a connected one).
	•	Be on Gnosis Chain with a bit of xDAI.
	•	Tap “Register with Circles” and fill a simple profile (name, maybe picture).

The app can:
	•	Internally pick an inviter (e.g. a Circles onboarding avatar or a nanoPay “guardian” avatar),
	•	Call sdk.register.asHuman(inviter, profile) for them,
	•	And then show “You’re now a Circles human avatar. You can start claiming CRC.”

So:
	•	You’re correct at UX level: users basically “just need to register first”.
	•	The only extra things behind the scenes are:
	•	There is an inviter address passed by the app, and
	•	A small profile object is created/pinned.

Suggested nanoPay wording (accurate but simple)

Something like:

How do I join Circles?
When you tap Register, nanoPay will:
	•	Connect your wallet on Gnosis Chain (xDAI)
	•	Create a simple Circles profile for you (name, avatar)
	•	Register your wallet as a human avatar in Circles

After that, you can start claiming CRC (up to 24 per day, 1 per hour) and sending it as social money to friends and groups.

No need to mention “inviter” in the UI; just handle it in your code with sdk.register.asHuman.
