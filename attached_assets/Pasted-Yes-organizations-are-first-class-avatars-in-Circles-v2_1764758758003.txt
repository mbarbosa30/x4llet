Yes—organizations are first-class avatars in Circles v2 and they’re simpler than humans (no inviter needed). Here’s the exact “how”.

What an Organization avatar is (v2)
	•	No inviter required. You can register directly from your wallet (EOA or Safe).  ￼
	•	No minting/UBI. Orgs don’t mint their own CRC; they receive/trust others and can route value. (Their balances are subject to the system’s demurrage rules.)  ￼

Step-by-step (SDK)

0) Init the SDK (Gnosis, chainId 100)

import { Sdk, circlesConfig } from '@aboutcircles/sdk';
import { Profiles } from '@aboutcircles/sdk-profiles';
import { ethers } from 'ethers';

const provider = new ethers.JsonRpcProvider('https://rpc.gnosischain.com');
const signer   = new ethers.Wallet(PRIVATE_KEY, provider);

// Browser dapp: use the connected wallet's signer instead.
const sdk = new Sdk(circlesConfig[100], signer);
const profiles = new Profiles();

1) Create a profile (pin to IPFS) and register the org

const profile = { name: 'Acme Relief', description: 'Local merchant coop' };
const cid = await profiles.create(profile);          // ipfs://<cid>
const org = await sdk.register.asOrganization(cid);  // returns OrganisationAvatar

That’s it: asOrganization(profileOrCid) creates the Organization avatar. No inviter param.  ￼

2) (Optional) Update on-chain metadata / short name

await org.profile.update({ name: 'Acme Relief', image: 'ipfs://...' });
// Optionally register a short name later:
await org.profile.registerShortName(nonce); // when exposed in your UI/workflow

Profile helpers pin JSON and update the avatar’s metadata digest for you.  ￼

Using a Gnosis Safe to control the Organization (recommended)

If you want the org to be multisig-controlled:
	1.	Create a Safe on Gnosis.
	2.	Instantiate the SDK with a Safe runner instead of a plain EOA signer.
	•	The Circles docs explicitly support custom runners (incl. Safe).  ￼
	•	Use the package that provides a SafeContractRunner for Circles SDK.  ￼

With a Safe runner in place, call the same sdk.register.asOrganization(...). All subsequent org.* writes (trust, transfers, profile updates) will be executed through the Safe.

After registration: what you can do

Accept and route CRC
	•	Get the avatar instance anytime: const org = await sdk.getAvatar(orgAddress) .  ￼
	•	Receive payments directly, or trust counterparties to open paths:

await org.trust.add(['0xFriendA', '0xShopB']);      // add trust edges (optional expiry)
const max = await org.transfer.getMaxAmount('0xBuyer');
await org.transfer.advanced('0xSeller', max, { useWrappedBalances: true });

Trust & transfer helpers are built into the avatar API.  ￼

If you need a pooled currency (not just an org)

Organizations don’t mint. If you want a shared currency with collateral rules, consider a Group avatar instead:

const group = await sdk.register.asGroup(owner, service, feeCollector, [], 'MarketCoop', 'MCO', profile);

Groups issue group tokens against trusted collateral—different purpose than orgs.  ￼

Common pitfalls / tips
	•	Already registered? Handle “avatar exists” gracefully by switching to sdk.getAvatar(address).  ￼
	•	Gas on Gnosis: pay in xDAI; you can sponsor writes behind your relayer if you want nanoPay to keep it gasless.
	•	Demurrage awareness: since orgs don’t mint, keep operational balances lean or route quickly.  ￼

⸻

TL;DR

Use:

const org = await sdk.register.asOrganization(profileOrCid);

No inviter required. Control it with an EOA or, better, a Gnosis Safe via a Safe runner. Then add trust edges and start accepting CRC from your community.  ￼

If you want, I can sketch a tiny React hook useCirclesOrg() that: pins profile → registers org → stores the address → exposes trust() and receive() helpers for your PWA.
