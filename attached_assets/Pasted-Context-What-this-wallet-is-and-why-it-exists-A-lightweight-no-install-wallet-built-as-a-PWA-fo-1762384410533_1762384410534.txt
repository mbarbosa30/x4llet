Context

What this wallet is (and why it exists)

A lightweight, no-install wallet built as a PWA for the real world—unreliable data, budget phones, shared devices. It sends and receives stablecoins gaslessly (you sign off-chain; we relay on-chain) and supports execute-by-link so a trusted person with internet can finalize a transfer for you. It also speaks HTTP 402 (“Payment Required”), letting websites, services, and agents charge per use without accounts.

Our aim is simple: cash-like digital payments that work for everyone—refugees, informal workers, community programs, and partners who need safer, faster rails for aid and commerce.

Who benefits
	•	Individuals in low-connectivity settings: quick setup, readable balances, pay/receive without handling gas or jargon.
	•	Communities & NGOs: safer disbursements via short-lived claim links; auditable, lower leakage than paper vouchers.
	•	Vendors & local services: charge per use (Wi-Fi minutes, charging, printing, rides) via x402, settle instantly in stablecoins.
	•	Browsers/telcos/fintechs: a drop-in Wallet-as-a-Service layer (relayer + x402 + link execution) to power gasless stablecoin UX.

How payments work (in plain language)
	•	You sign; we relay: We use standards like EIP-3009 (e.g., USDC’s transferWithAuthorization / receiveWithAuthorization). You approve a payment off-chain; our relayer submits it on-chain and pays gas.
	•	Execute-by-link:
	•	Claim links (default): funds can only be claimed by the intended recipient address (safer if an SMS or chat link leaks).
	•	Short expiry + one-time use: links auto-expire and can’t be replayed.
	•	Pay-over-HTTP (x402): When a site returns “Payment Required”, the wallet shows a small pay sheet; you approve; the page unlocks—no new account or KYC forms.

⸻

What you can expect in the app
	•	Create wallet in seconds: local key stored in an encrypted vault (WebCrypto + IndexedDB).
	•	Home: clear balance in stablecoin + local-currency preview; recent activity.
	•	Send: enter handle/address or scan QR → confirm → gasless send.
	•	Receive: static QR + address + “request amount” links.
	•	Execute a link: open a short URL → review details → one tap to finalize.
	•	Offline-friendly: view balances/QRs offline; queued actions retry when online.

⸻

Safety & privacy by design
	•	Self-custodial: your key stays on your device; we never hold your funds.
	•	Encrypted vault: keys are encrypted at rest; auto-lock on inactivity; no keys in localStorage; no analytics on sensitive actions.
	•	Clear confirmations: every payment shows recipient, amount, network, and contract before you approve.
	•	Single-use, expiring links: each link has a unique nonce, short expiry, and idempotent execution.
	•	Allowlisted networks & tokens: we default to native USDC on supported chains; bridged or incompatible tokens are blocked.
	•	Minimal data exhaust: we store only what’s needed to relay transactions (e.g., nonces). Browsing history and balances stay on your device.

⸻

Supported tokens & networks
	•	Primary: native USDC on supported networks (e.g., Base, Celo).
	•	Fallbacks: where EIP-3009 isn’t available, we may use ERC-2612 permit via a single-use executor (if the token supports it).

Availability can vary by region and partner integration. We’ll always show the exact network and contract before you approve.

⸻

Aid & program payouts (what makes this safer)
	•	Claim-only disbursements: beneficiaries receive claim links that only their wallet can execute.
	•	Revocation & expiry: unclaimed links expire quickly; issuers can cancel outstanding links where supported.
	•	Transparency: each payout has a human-readable receipt; auditors can verify on-chain.
	•	Cash-out flexibility: programs can pair wallet payouts with local agents, mobile money, or bank rails (outside the wallet).

Partners: Wallet-as-a-Service (WaaS)

Integrate gasless payments and x402 in days, not months:
	•	Relayer API: submit EIP-3009/permit authorizations; sponsor gas; get tx receipts.
	•	x402 gateway: standard 402 challenges for pay-per-use content/services.
	•	Capsule links: create short, expiring execute-by-link flows (claim or push).
	•	White-label PWA hooks: keep your UX—use ours under the hood.

Contact us if you’re a browser, telco, NGO, or fintech looking to pilot.

Roadmap highlights
	•	More local ramps: improved cash-in/out partners and bank/fiat bridges.
	•	Guardians & recovery: optional social/guardian recovery (no seed phrases).
	•	Spending controls: daily caps and “new-recipient” cool-offs on by default.
	•	Accessibility: low-bandwidth mode, larger text, right-to-left support.

⸻

Known limitations
	•	Requires some connectivity to execute a payment (signing can be done offline, then executed when online).
	•	Token support is intentionally strict (security > breadth).
	•	Not a bank or money transmitter; self-custodial wallet software only.

Responsible use & disclaimers

Use this wallet only where digital assets are legal and appropriate. Values can fluctuate; stablecoins carry issuer and network risk. Always confirm recipient and network details before approving a payment. If a device is lost or compromised, rotate your wallet immediately using your backup.
