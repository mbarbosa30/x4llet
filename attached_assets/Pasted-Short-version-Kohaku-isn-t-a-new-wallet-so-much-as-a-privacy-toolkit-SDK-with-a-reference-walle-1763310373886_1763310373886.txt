Short version: Kohaku isn’t “a new wallet” so much as a privacy toolkit + SDK with a reference wallet (a browser extension fork) from the Ethereum Foundation. It’s meant for other wallets to plug in privacy primitives (private sends/receives, IP/metadata shielding, dapp-scoped accounts, P2P broadcast, social recovery modules, etc.), not to replace them.  ￼

What Kohaku is (in practice)
	•	An open SDK + reference wallet you can copy pieces from, not a consumer app.  ￼
	•	Goal: make “privacy by default” feel normal in wallets by minimizing what a payment reveals (who learns what, and when).  ￼
	•	Roadmap highlights you can adopt piecemeal:
	•	Private send/receive/payment flows via pluggable privacy protocols, with an aggregated balance view.
	•	Traffic/IP shielding and avoiding unnecessary RPC leakage (Helios light client in-browser; “oblivious” reads).
	•	One account per dapp (address isolation), P2P tx broadcast (skip surveillance-prone RPC paths).
	•	Social recovery via zkEmail / Anon Aadhaar, and policy modules (spend limits).
	•	Forward-looking: privacy-preserving AA alignment.  ￼

How this maps to nanoPay.live (your PWA)

Think of Kohaku as a “Privacy Mode” layer you add on top of your current rails (EOA + EIP-3009 gasless + execute-by-link + x402). Keep your thin, fast default; let users toggle privacy when it matters.

Drop-in plan (modular, least-risk first)
	1.	Metadata minimization (no UX change)
	•	Use Kohaku’s patterns to mask IP/traffic and avoid RPC leakage; prefer Helios (WASM light client) with a controlled fallback RPC.
	•	Outcome: fewer linkages from network metadata, even for normal 3009 sends.  ￼
	2.	Address isolation
	•	Offer “one account per dapp” as an advanced setting (or auto for new dapps).
	•	Outcome: dapps don’t trivially correlate activity; great for vulnerable users.  ￼
	3.	Private send / receive (opt-in)
	•	Add a “Private” tab beside your current “Send.” When chosen, route through a Kohaku-compatible privacy plugin (e.g., Railgun integration per roadmap).
	•	Show an aggregated balance that merges public + private holdings so the user still feels “one wallet.”  ￼
	4.	P2P transaction broadcast
	•	For “high-risk” payouts, try peer-to-peer broadcast instead of a public RPC (where supported), to reduce metadata trails.  ￼
	5.	Private x402
	•	When a site throws HTTP 402, let the user pick Public vs Private spend. If Private, execute through the privacy module and masked reads; if not available, gracefully fall back to your current 3009 flow. (Kohaku’s goal is exactly this: wallet-level privacy as plumbing.)  ￼
	6.	Recovery & policies (for aid programs)
	•	Offer guardian/social recovery modules (zkEmail / Anon Aadhaar) and spending policies (daily caps, new-recipient cool-offs) as optional community presets.  ￼
	7.	4337 synergy (optional “pro mode”)
	•	Keep your 3009 rail for speed/compatibility. Add an AA account path for universal gas sponsorship + policy/modules where privacy flows need it. Kohaku’s roadmap points to privacy-preserving AA longer-term, so this won’t dead-end.  ￼

Minimal architecture changes
	•	Add a PrivacyRail next to your current Rail3009:
	•	canPay(): checks if a private route exists for the token/chain.
	•	buildPayIntent(): constructs the private send/receive (plus masked reads).
	•	submit(): prefers P2P broadcast; otherwise masked RPC.
	•	State/UI: a single source of truth for balances with a “private components” overlay (Kohaku’s aggregated balances concept).  ￼

What you get
	•	Real-world safety: less correlatable metadata, fewer passive leaks (IPs, RPC paths).  ￼
	•	Cleaner aid flows: NGO disbursements that don’t spray beneficiary graphs across explorers; still auditable at the program level. EF is also launching an Institutional Privacy Task Force to map tech ↔ compliance, which you can align to.  ￼
	•	Future-proofing: Kohaku is an EF-backed path; SDK + ref wallet are public today. You can adopt pieces without betting the farm.  ￼

Issues / trade-offs (and how to handle them)
	•	Performance & device limits: some privacy flows (ZK proofs, masked reads) add latency/size—keep them opt-in and cache wisely.  ￼
	•	Counterparty support: private sends may require compatible protocols on the receiver’s side; default to your 3009 rail if not available.  ￼
	•	Regulatory nuance: privacy ≠ non-compliance. Use program-level attestation/receipts and spending policies; track EF’s IPTF guidance.  ￼
	•	PWA vs extension: some Kohaku pieces debuted in a browser extension fork (Ambire). You can still use the SDK concepts in a PWA—start with metadata minimization and private sends, then consider an optional extension build if you want deepest integration.  ￼

TL;DR for nanoPay.live
	•	Keep your fast EOA + EIP-3009 path as default.
	•	Add Kohaku-style modules as a toggleable Privacy Mode:
	1.	mask IP/traffic + local light client
	2.	dapp-scoped addresses
	3.	private send/receive + aggregated balances
	4.	P2P broadcast where possible
	5.	optional social recovery & spend policies
	6.	AA “pro mode” for universal gasless + session keys
All of this is consistent with EF’s “privacy as normal” push and the official Kohaku SDK/roadmap.  ￼

If you want, I can sketch the exact interface for a PrivacyRail and a two-tab Send (Public | Private) flow that drops into your current React PWA.
