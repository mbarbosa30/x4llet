Yes—this works, and you can keep it simple, sustainable, and fair. Think of it as a Yield Endowment → Weekly Claims pipeline, trust-weighted by MaxFlow.

1) One-page design
	•	Partner Endowment (e.g., $1M USDC). Funds sit in an Aave v3 vault the partner can withdraw anytime. Only the yield is harvested.
	•	Weekly budget B_t. Once a week the indexer harvests realized yield (EMA-smoothed) into a Claims Pot. Optionally add ISP spread, merchant rebates, donations.
	•	Eligible set. Wallets with MaxFlow score ≥ τ (and not flagged) for that community.
	•	Trust-weighted split (with floor & cap). Each eligible wallet gets:
a_i = \underbrace{f_t}_{\text{floor}}+\left(B_t - f_t N\right)\cdot\frac{w_i}{\sum_j w_j},\quad
w_i = \big(\text{normalize}(S_i)\big)^{p}\cdot(1-\text{dilution}_i)^{q}\cdot(1+\text{redundancy}_i)^{r}
Clamp per-wallet cap a_i \le c_t. Redistribute any leftovers.
	•	Claim, don’t stream. Users claim once per week (hard cooldown). Unclaimed expires after 14 days (or rolls over once by 50%).
	•	“Help anyone.” Anyone can:
	•	Boost next claim: donate USDC to a person’s this-week pot; or
	•	Top-up BoostPay: donate directly to reduce their BNPL outstanding.

Keep it community-scoped: each partner/NGO can run its own pool + graph, with global opt-in possible later.

2) Concrete numbers (so expectations are real)
	•	If partner deposits $1M @ 6% APY, annual yield ≈ $60k → ~$1,154/week.
	•	With N=2,000 eligible:
	•	Floor 40% → f_t = 0.4\cdot B_t/N \approx \$0.23 each.
	•	The remaining 60% is trust-weighted: top-score users might see $0.70–$1.20, median $0.30–$0.50.
	•	To raise per-head impact: (a) add merchant/ISP revenue, (b) bring co-sponsors, (c) segment pools (smaller N), (d) run campaign boosts (donation matches).

3) Implementation (minimal, shippable)

On-chain (tiny)
	•	PartnerYieldVault (or use your existing SavingsVault):
	•	Tracks principal baseline (partner’s deposit).
	•	Weekly harvest() = max(0, aTokenValue − principalBaseline − buffer). Sends USDC to ClaimsTreasury.
	•	ClaimsTreasury: receives harvested USDC + donations.
	•	ClaimManager (Merkle + cooldown):
	•	setEpoch(e, root, start, end, budget) (owner = IssuanceController).
	•	claim(e, amount, proof) — once per epoch per address (hard cooldown), gasless via relayer. Expiry after grace.
	•	(Optional later) Simple AuctionHouse if you ever move to a redeemable token; not needed for USDC claims.

Off-chain
	•	Trust indexer (MaxFlow): returns S_i, redundancy, dilution.
	•	Budget/weights builder (cron weekly):
	1.	Read realized yield (EMA) → B_t (keep 20% to buffer for APY shocks).
	2.	Build eligible set (S_i \ge τ).
	3.	Compute a_i using floor/cap/weights (p≈1, q≈0.5, r≈0.5).
	4.	Add boosts from person-specific donations.
	5.	Emit Merkle root → ClaimManager.setEpoch.
	•	Relayer: gasless claim() + donation helpers + execute-by-link.

Wallet (nanoPay)
	•	/claim: big “Claim weekly” button, next timer, “expires in 14 days.”
	•	/help: choose beneficiary → Boost next claim or Top-up BoostPay (one-tap). Optional “repeat 4 weeks”.
	•	Transparency card: “This week: Budget $1,154 • Eligible 2,000 • Median claim $0.42 • Unclaimed last week $210 → buffer.”

4) Safeguards & policy knobs
	•	Anti-sybil: threshold τ; haircut weights for low-redundancy/high-dilution clusters; new wallets 1-week warm-up.
	•	Smoothing: use EMA APY, allocate 80% of harvest to claims, 20% to buffer. If APY dips, release buffer to keep claims stable.
	•	Fairness: min floor 30–50% of B_t; per-wallet cap c_t (e.g., ≤ 0.5–1.0% of B_t).
	•	Opt-out partner controls: pause, withdraw principal, cap weekly spend, community scoping.

5) “Help anyone” that scales
	•	Boost next claim = simple donation tagged to user’s epoch; it directly increases a_i for the week.
	•	Top-up BoostPay = donation goes to the person’s outstanding BNPL (visible impact).
	•	Later: auto-boost (repeat N weeks), community match (partner 1:1 within a cap).

6) Why this is sustainable
	•	You never touch principal—only realized yield + revenue + donations.
	•	Hard weekly budget; claims expire; buffer smooths volatility.
	•	MaxFlow-weighted means funds concentrate where the network has real confidence, while the floor ensures everyone eligible gets something.

If you want, I’ll draft:
	•	a 100-line PartnerYieldVault.harvest() stub,
	•	a ClaimManager Merkle/cooldown contract,
	•	and the weekly builder script (reads MaxFlow, computes a_i, posts root).
